description: "A directory traversal vulnerability exists in OneCommander version 3.102.0.0, caused by insufficient validation of file paths during ZIP archive extraction. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must extract a malicious ZIP archive. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user."

The vulnerability resides in the ZIP extraction logic used by OneCommander. During the extraction process, the application fails to validate archive entry paths, allowing relative directory traversal sequences such as `../../AppData/` to be passed directly to the file system. This behavior results from insufficient path validation in both the underlying `SevenZipSharp` library and the application.

An attacker can exploit this behavior to extract malicious files into the user’s Startup folder, enabling arbitrary code execution when the system is boots.

The vendor resolved the issue by completely removing the ZIP extraction feature from OneCommander. The fix is included in versions 3.103.0 (Standalone) and 3.102.1 (Microsoft Store).
