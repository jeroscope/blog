description: "A directory traversal vulnerability exists in OneCommander version 3.102.0.0, caused by insufficient validation of file paths during ZIP archive extraction. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must extract a malicious ZIP archive. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user."

The vulnerability resides in the ZIP extraction logic used by OneCommander. When extracting ZIP entries, the application does not correctly normalize or restrict path traversal sequences embedded in the archive. Filenames containing relative path patterns (e.g., `../../AppData/`) are passed directly to the filesystem without sufficient filtering.

Because OneCommander does not enforce confinement to the chosen extraction directory, ZIP entries with malicious traversal paths can escape the target folder and write to arbitrary locations within the user’s filesystem. This behavior is influenced by the underlying SevenZipSharp library, which lacks strict path validation, as well as by the application’s absence of additional safety checks.

An attacker can exploit this behavior to extract malicious files into the user’s Startup folder, enabling arbitrary code execution when the system is rebooted.

The vendor resolved the issue by completely removing the ZIP extraction feature from OneCommander. The fix is included in versions 3.103.0 (Standalone) and 3.102.1 (Microsoft Store).
