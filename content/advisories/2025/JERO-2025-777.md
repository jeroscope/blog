JavaScript support in PDF renderers and editors enables dynamic documents that can change based on user input or events. There exists an uninitialized pointer vulnerability in the way  handles a signature object. This can be illustrated by the following proof-of-concept code:

```javascript
function main() { 

    sig_info = app.activeDocs[0].getField("Signature_0").signatureInfo(); 

    app.activeDocs[0].getField("Signature_0").setLock(true);

    JSON.stringify(sig_info); 

}
```

The above JavaScript code causes the creation of the `CPDF_Signature` object, and a field in the object is not initialized. Later, this uninitialized pointer field is accessed without any validation.
