The instruction at which the vulnerability occurs is as follows:
```
(591c.504c): Access violation - code c0000005 (!!! second chance !!!)
PDFXEditCore_x64!PXV_GetInstance+0x668664:
00007fff`be028964 488b07          mov     rax,qword ptr [rdi] ds:00000000`00000000=????????????????
```

This issue occurs when the second argument of `importDataObject(name, pathOrUrl)` contains either a **URI scheme** or a **path that includes a single backslash**. If the argument contains a colon (`:`), the internal scheme-validation logic is invoked. When unsupported or untrusted schemes such as `about:` or `javascript:` are supplied—or when `this.URL` is passed—the scheme parser returns an **ERROR_OBJECT**, which subsequently leads to a null pointer dereference.

In the case of a path containing a single backslash (e.g., `"C:\test.txt"`), JavaScript string-escaping corrupts the path, causing the file-open operation to fail and again resulting in an **ERROR_OBJECT** that triggers a null pointer dereference. Notably, when `this.URL` is used as the second argument, the application terminates immediately without requiring any user interaction.
